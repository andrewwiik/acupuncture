          <h1>History & Philosophy of Acupuncture</h1>

          <p> As apart of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), acupuncture is an ancient Chinese healing art which has been practiced for about five thousand years. This medical system has been used to diagnose, treat and prevent diseases and provide relief
            from pain. Acupuncture is based on the Chinese philosophy that energy or (Qi) flows through meridians underlying the physical body. The energy should flow smoothly along these meridians, otherwise illness may result. An Acupuncture Point is
            a doorway into the meridian. The needle stimulates the energy to flow properly by removing blockages. The needles are very fine (about two times the thickness of a human hair). After removing the blockage, the body is restored to a harmonious
            energetic balance. This enables the body to heal itself and maintain a more body, mind, spirit harmony. Acupuncture helps to promote a smooth functioning of hormones, nerves, blood supply, neurotransmitters and vital organs. This holistic
            approach is a safe, effective and essentially pain-free way to treat many health problems. The effectiveness of acupuncture is well documented by the World Health Organization and the US Department of Health and Human Services (see <a target="_blank"
              href="http://www.news-medical.net/health/Acupuncture-Efficacy.aspx">http://www.news-medical.net/health/Acupuncture-Efficacy.aspx</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://nccih.nih.gov/health/acupuncture/introduction">https://nccih.nih.gov/health/acupuncture/introduction</a>).
          </p>
          <p>Our body's Qi energy paths are easily blocked or thrown off balance due to stress, poor diet, lack of exercise, lack of sleep, trauma, extremes in weather, pollutants, etc. Western Medicine modalities alone do not always produce the outcomes
            that restore health and balance. Many people are exploring the efficacy of Eastern modalities such as acupuncture and T.C.M. for a more natural and holistic approach to health while avoiding the negative side effects of harsh drugs or chemical
            based prescriptions. Therefore, acupuncture and Western medicine modalities can be used together often in complementary ways, although some medications may hamper the effects of acupuncture. Ask your acupuncturist health provider for further
            details. The World Health Organization and National Institute of Health both endorse the health benefits of acupuncture. </p>

          <h1>Who is Acupuncture For?</h1>

          <p> Acupuncture is useful for everyone from children to the elderly. Many types of pain and injuries can be treated, to help reduce pain, increase the circulation of blood, relax muscle spasms, break up scar tissue and helps the body heal faster.
            Stress is responsible for many illnesses and affects how we fell. The reduction of stress can greatly enhance our mood, spirit, energy, and gives us hope. Acupuncture helps relax us and defends against illness. Athletes use acupuncture for
            optimal performance. Acupuncture is effective in reducing the side effects of chemotherapy. Acupuncture helps the immune system. Acupuncture can help people with chronic infections or infections resistant to antibiotics, menstrual problems,
            PMS, and infertility (men & women). Acupuncture treatments for paralysis due to a stroke or bell's palsy can help one to regain movement of muscles and help with speech problems. Acupuncture can help one to discover inner strength within ourselves
            to deal with and overcome emotional traumas as well as physical trauma. Acupuncture often assists people to develop a better quality, fuller, richer life. </p>

          <h1>Treatment</h1>

          <p>An average acupuncture session lasts an hour. Upon coming to the office you will be asked questions so that you can be evaluated according to the principles of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Very fine sterilized needles will be placed at specific
            points on the body. When the needles are inserted you may experience a warm, tingling, or heavy sensation. You may feel no sensation at all. The needles are retained in the body for about 15 minutes or so. While the needles are in, the best
            thing you can do is to relax you mind and body. The acupuncture will also help you relax and some people fall asleep during the treatment. Most patients feel better directly after the treatment. The of the treatment will increase in the next
            day or so. Occasionally a patient's symptoms will worsen before getting better. Treatments are normally once a week for about 6-8 weeks depending on the patient's condition, or as many as 3-4 times a week for patients with severe pain, for
            post stroke patients, and other severe conditions. After six to eight treatments, the progress of the patient's condition will be evaluated. As symptoms improve, fewer visits are needed or acupuncture can be discontinued all together.</p>

          <h1>Acupuncture Techniques</h1>
          <p>Besides, the use of very fine needles applied at acupuncture points, there are many other different modalities that are used with acupuncture. These include moxibustion (heat therapy), mild electrical stimulation, cupping, gua sha, amma message
            therapy, tui na massage, chinese herbal supplements, nutritional supplements, and blood pressure normalizer. The acupuncture practitioner will help the patient learn how to maintain his or her own mind-body-spirit balance through patterns
            of exercise, rest, diet and nutrition. </p>


          <h1>Certification and Licensing</h1>
          <p>The regulations of acupuncture varies from state to state. New York and New Jersey require that you be licensed to practice acupuncture. In order to receive a license, one must complete training with an acupuncture accredited program such as
            the Accreditation Commision of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine. NY & NJ also require one to successfully complete the examination of the National Certification Commision for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (NCCAOM). Medical Doctors D.O.'s
            and Chiropractors are only required to complete a 300 hour program to perform acupuncture, as opposed to most acupuncture schools which offer Masters Degree programs that require an average of 2500 hours or more of study and are required to
            take the National Certification Commision Exam for licensure.</p>

          <h1>What is Qi?</h1>
          <p> At the core of this ancient medicine is the philosophy that Qi (pronounced “chee”), the vital energy, flows throughout the body. Qi animates the body and protects it from illness, pain and disease. A person’s health is influenced by the quality,
            quantity and balance of Qi. </p>

          <h1>How Does Qi Move?</h1>
          <p> Qi flows through specific pathways called meridians. There are fourteen main meridians inside the body. The diagram to the left shows the meridian pathways in the body. Each of these is connected to specific organs and glands. Meridian pathways
            are like rivers flowing inside the body. Where a river flows, it transports life giving water that provides nourishment to the land, plants and people. Similarly, where meridian pathways flow, they bring life giving Qi that provides nourishment
            to every cell, organ, gland, tissue, and muscle in the body. </p>

          <h1>How is Qi Disrupted?</h1>

          <p> An obstruction to the flow of Qi is like a dam. When Qi becomes backed up in one part of the body, the flow becomes restricted in other parts. This blockage of the flow of Qi can be detrimental to a person’s health, cutting off vital nourishment
            to the body, organs and glands. Physical and emotional trauma, stress, lack of exercise, overexertion, seasonal changes, poor diet, accidents, or excessive activity are among the many things that can influence the quality, quantity and balance
            of Qi. Normally, when a blockage or imbalance occurs, the body easily bounces back, returning to a state of health and well being. However, when this disruption is prolonged or excessive, or if the body is in a weakened state, illness, pain,
            or disease can set in.</p>
